# msulogin - sulogin for multiple root accounts sulogin

 is the single user mode login program used to force the console user to login under a root account before a shell is started. Unlike other implementations of sulogin, this one supports having multiple root accounts on a system.

msulogin has been developed as part of Owl and is being made available separately primarily for use by other distributions. Currently, msulogin supports only systems with getspnam(3).
